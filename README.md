# Water Hyacinth Calculation for EcoWB

## Google Earth Engine script for calculating area of water hyacinth

## Geometry and Bounds
This script uses a geometry constant named LAKEVICTORIA. This constant is applied to a variable called FullGulf which is used for all calculations. To make this script work with a new geometry, you will need to refactor the fullGulf variable with your desired geometry and everything should work as intended.
